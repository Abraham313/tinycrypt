Kim looks delightful here as always. I remember being at the Maddox Club when Kanye and Kim were escorted into the VIP area. I was chilling out at the bar, drinking mojitos when song began to play: Soul Makossa by Manu Dibango. All I could hear was this clapping and cheering by a crowd assembled on the dancefloor. Went down to investigate and saw Kim doing this spectacular dance. The whole club was captivated and mesmerized. Men had to be taken away in ambulances...what an amazing night it was too. Never forget. Love Kim. xoxo
