/**

There are some operations within the SM4 cipher that I would argue aren't
necessary at all. First is the byte swap operation before and after
encryption. Second is the swap/permutation of values at the end of
encryption. Omission of this shouldn't affect the security of the cipher.

Despite this, we see similar operations used in various block ciphers. 
e.g Blowfish,Bel-T, DES. IMHO, it's just a wasted operation that achieves
nothing. Little-endian should be the preferred storage of data, because
almost 100% of the CPUs in circulation use little-endian mode. Not that
there's anything wrong with the 90s, but we're not in the 90s anymore.
This cipher was probably designed around the same time as AES.

It's a poorly designed cipher based on AES.
